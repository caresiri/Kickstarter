## Description

## Data

The dataset consists of Kickstarter **Technology** projects. The
original dataset was obtained from
[webrobots](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/ "webrobots").
This data was used to webscrape the listed URLs.

The dataset used for this analysis can be obtained from the following
link:
[Data](https://exploratory.io/data/cDb6UEd0cT/Kickstarter-YvT3sWY5YT "Data")

## Variables

**State**: Project state \[ Successful, Failed, Cancelled and Live\].
For this analysis I eliminated Canceled and Live.

**Goal**: The amount of funds the project owners wish to collect.

**Generated variables**

**Has\_Patent**: Generated binary variable reflecting if the text within
the site has the word patent.It outputsthe web scrapping results of the
target words \[Patent|patent\].

**log\_goal**: Log of goal amount.

## The effect of Has\_Patent and Goal

For an exploratory dasbhoard follow this link: [Has-Patent and
Goal](https://exploratory.io/dashboard/cDb6UEd0cT/Patent-vs-State-Duration-KTO9mmV1iv "Has-Patent and Goal")

## Relationship between patent and state

I explore the relationship between the **state** and **Has\_Patent**.

The Chi Square Test initially suggest that project with patents tend to
be less successful. The following sections show that this might be due
to some interactions.

    ##      
    ##       failed successful
    ##   No    3179       2916
    ##   Yes    247         98

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  df_test$Has_Patent and df_test$state
    ## X-squared = 48.767, df = 1, p-value = 2.883e-12

The following dashboard also sumarizes the data:

## The effect of Has\_Patent and Goal on State

This section explores the relationship between **Has\_Patent** and
**Goal** with **State**. The regression suggests that **Has\_Patent**
and **Goal** has an effect on **state**, there is also some interaction
(p\<.1) between **Has\_Patent** and **Goal**.
